# Invisible clock
Have you ever seen Harry Potterâ€™s Invisible Cloak; Was it wonderful? Have you ever wanted to wear that cloak? If Yes!! then in this post, we will build the same cloak which Harry Potter uses to become invisible. Yes, we are not building it in a real way but it is all about graphics trickery.

# Algorithm:
1. Capture and store the background frame  This will be done for some seconds.
2. Detect the red colored cloth using color detection and segmentation algorithm.
3. Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask.
4. Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect.
